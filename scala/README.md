# Scala implementation of Strange Characters Test Design Kata

Please read [main instructions](../README.md).

## Implementation details

This implementation has been scaffolded with:

```shell
sbt new scala/scala3.g8
```

Then adapted to follow original C# implementation.

The trickiest part is adapting C#'s nullable reference types to Scala's `Option` type.

There is a GitHub Action build that can verify that all code is properly formatted and all tests are passing.
