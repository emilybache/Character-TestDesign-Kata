# Strange Characters Test Design Kata

Information about the requirements are here: [Strange Characters Kata Description](https://www.sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/strange_characters.html)

There are some well-marked bugs in the code. For each one:

- Create a new (empty) test case to expose the bug. Write a comment or good test name that explains what the bug is
- Write the body of the test case: it should fail because of the bug
- Fix the bug: the test case should now pass.

You could do this as part of a [Learning Hour](https://www.sammancoaching.org/learning_hours/test_design/asserting_on_collections.html)
